# FEM
###### Generalized python code to solve 1-D and 2-D problems in Finite Element Methods (FEM)



The codes were prepared as part of the coursework titled **MIN 511B- Finite Element Methods**, as taught in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. 

The questions on which the codes are based is also attached. Detailed documentation on the abilities and properties are given inside the codes. 

The 1-D is a work of great pride for me. It can solve almost all axially loaded linear-elastic bar problems lying in a direction parallel to the X axis. 

The 2-D code is with its own issues as I have tried for an automated meshing system. Nevertheless it can accommodate simple problems with triangular, quadrilateral or rectangular meshes.
